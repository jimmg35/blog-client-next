A Geographic Information System is comprised of several key components that work together to perform spatial analysis and data management. These components include hardware, software, data, people, and methods. Hardware refers to the physical devices used to run GIS software and store data. Software includes the programs and applications used for data analysis and visualization. Data encompasses the spatial and attribute information that GIS operates on. People are the users and professionals who manage and interpret GIS data. Methods involve the procedures and techniques used to analyze and process spatial information. Together, these components form the foundation of any GIS system.

- **Hardware**
  Physical devices such as computers and GPS units that are used to run GIS software and store data.
- **Software**
  Programs and applications designed for data analysis, visualization, and management (e.g., ArcGIS, QGIS).
- **Data**
  Spatial and attribute information that GIS systems process, including vector and raster data.
- **People**
  Users and professionals who manage, analyze, and interpret GIS data.
- **Methods**
  Procedures and techniques used for spatial analysis and data processing, such as data collection, preprocessing, and modeling.
