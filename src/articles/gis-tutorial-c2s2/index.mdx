GIS data can be obtained from a variety of sources, classified broadly into primary and secondary data sources. Primary data sources involve data collected directly through methods like field surveys, GPS measurements, and remote sensing. Secondary data sources include pre-existing data obtained from databases, government agencies, and research institutions. Understanding these sources helps GIS professionals gather accurate and relevant data for their projects.

- **Primary Data Sources**
  Data collected directly through surveys, GPS, and remote sensing.
  Examples include field measurements, satellite imagery, and aerial photographs.
- **Secondary Data Sources**
  Pre-existing data from databases, government agencies, and research institutions.
  Examples include census data, topographic maps, and existing GIS datasets.
