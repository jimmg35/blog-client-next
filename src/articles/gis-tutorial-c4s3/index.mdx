Geospatial modeling involves using mathematical and statistical techniques to understand and predict spatial phenomena. In this section, we will discuss statistical models and predictive modeling. These approaches are crucial for analyzing spatial patterns, making predictions, and supporting decision-making processes in various applications.

- **Statistical Models**
  - Applying statistical methods to analyze spatial data and identify patterns.
- **Predictive Modeling**
  - Using data-driven models to forecast future spatial phenomena.
