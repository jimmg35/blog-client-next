Basic spatial analysis techniques form the foundation of GIS by allowing users to understand spatial relationships and patterns. In this section, we will explore methods such as buffering, overlay analysis, and spatial joins. These techniques help in identifying proximity, combining data layers, and linking spatial data with attribute information.

- **Buffering**
  - Creating buffer zones around spatial features to analyze proximity.
- **Overlay Analysis**
  - Combining multiple data layers to identify spatial relationships.
- **Spatial Joins**
  - Linking spatial data with attribute data based on location.
