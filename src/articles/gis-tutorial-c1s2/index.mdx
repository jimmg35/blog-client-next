The history of GIS dates back to the 1960s when the first computer-based geographic information systems were developed. Over the decades, GIS technology has evolved significantly, transitioning from basic mapping tools to sophisticated systems capable of complex spatial analysis and real-time data processing. This evolution has been driven by advancements in computer technology, increased availability of spatial data, and the growing recognition of the value of geospatial analysis in decision-making processes.
