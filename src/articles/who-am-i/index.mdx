![Welcome](/images/programming.jpg 'a title')

Hello! I'm Jia Jun Chang (Jim), a highly motivated and dedicated professional with a strong background in GIS and Web development. With a Master's degree from National Taiwan Normal University, I have lots of experience in the development of web applications.

## What have I done?

My career includes research at NTNU on air quality prediction models and real estate appraisal decision support systems. As a full-stack developer at China Credit Information Service, I enhanced appraisal processes with geospatial technology, showcasing skills in data preprocessing, system integration, and algorithm implementation.

During my internship at NADI System Corp., I developed web GIS platforms and backend systems, integrating 3D GIS with building information models for clients like Delta Electronics and F5. At Interactive Digital Technologies Inc., I worked with ESRI technology, developing web applications for aerial image analysis and collaborating on a confidential video streaming platform using Microsoft SignalR.

## Not just a workaholic, but even a research-type person.

I have published and presented research on convolutional neural networks and earthquake risk exposure estimation. I also organized technical meetings and shared expertise with fellow students at NTNU.

Overall, my professional experiences and expertise in geospatial analysis and remote sensing make me a valuable asset to any team or project requiring spatial data expertise and innovative problem-solving skills.
