## Who am I?

Hello! I'm Jia Jun Chang, a highly motivated and dedicated professional with a strong background in GIS and Web development. With a Master's degree from National Taiwan Normal University, I have lots of experience in the development of web applications.

## What have I done?

My career journey has been enriched with diverse experiences, including research roles at NTNU where I contributed to projects involving air quality prediction models and the development of decision support systems for real estate appraisement. Moreover, my tenure as a researcher and full-stack developer at China Credit Information Service has allowed me to apply geospatial technology to enhance appraisal processes, demonstrating my proficiency in data preprocessing, system integration, and algorithm implementation.

During my internship at NADI System Corp., I honed my skills in web GIS platforms and backend development, collaborating on projects that integrated 3D GIS techniques with building information models for clients such as Delta Electronics and F5. Additionally, my time as a summer intern at Interactive Digital Technologies Inc. provided me with exposure to the ESRI technology ecosystem and practical experience in developing web applications for aerial image analysis. Furthermore, I had corporated with several senior developers on a confidential project, where I was a frontend developer developing video streaming platform using Microsoft SignalR.

## Not just a workaholic, but even a research-type person.

I have actively contributed to academia through publications and presentations at conferences, showcasing my research on topics ranging from convolutional neural networks for image recognition to space-time traffic corridor earthquake risk exposure estimation.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I have demonstrated leadership through organizing technical meetings and sharing expertise with fellow students at NTNU. My passion for knowledge sharing and commitment to continuous learning drives me to excel in my field and contribute meaningfully to the geospatial community.

Overall, my professional experiences, coupled with my expertise in geospatial analysis and remote sensing, position me as asset in any team or project requiring spatial data expertise and innovative problem-solving skills.
