Spatial data in GIS is broadly categorized into two types: vector data and raster data. Understanding these data types is crucial for effective GIS analysis and application. Vector data represents features as discrete geometric shapes like points, lines, and polygons, which are used to model entities such as cities, roads, and boundaries. Raster data, on the other hand, represents the world as a continuous surface composed of a grid of cells or pixels, commonly used for imagery like satellite photos and aerial images.

- **Vector Data**
  Represents features using points, lines, and polygons.
  Suitable for discrete data such as city locations, road networks, and administrative boundaries.
- **Raster Data**
  Represents the world as a continuous surface with a grid of cells or pixels.
  Ideal for continuous data such as elevation, temperature, and satellite imagery.
